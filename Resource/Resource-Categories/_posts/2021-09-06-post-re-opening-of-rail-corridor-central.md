The Rail Corridor (Central) is now officially re-opened!

Since July 2019, the stretch between the Upper Bukit Timah truss bridge and Bukit Timah truss bridge was closed for trail enhancement works. The truss bridges also underwent refurbishment to improve its durability, safety, and acccessibility.

The enhanced trail now contains various improvements, including the introduction of new and enhanced visitor access points, sensitive restoration of heritage landmarks and the restoration of a belt of native forest as an important passage, habitat, and source of food for Singapore's native fauna, particularly those from the nearby Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. This improves access of the corridor, allowing users of all abilities to enjoy this unique green space, while conserving its built heritage for future generations to enjoy.

You may refer to the map below for the access points along the Rail Corridor (Central).

You may also refer to the map HERE to check out which stretches are opened/closed. Please note that while the Rail Corridor is opened 24/7, there are no lighting along the Rail Corridor, except at major intersections, to facilitate movement of our nocturnal wildlife.
