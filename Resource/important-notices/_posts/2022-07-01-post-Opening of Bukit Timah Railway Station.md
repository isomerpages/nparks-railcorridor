**Bukit Timah Railway Station**

The conserved Bukit Timah Railway Station building was built in 1932 and is one of two extant railway stations in Singapore. Along with its key architectural and railway elements, the railway station has been sensitively and carefully restored and repurposed as a heritage gallery for visitors to learn about its history and that of the Rail Corridor.

In the building, you can see restored elements like track switching levers, ticketing booth, and a replica of a signals diagram in the Signal Room, which former Station Masters used to control rail traffic. Do note that entry to the Signal Room is not allowed, but you can observe its interior from the entrance.
To the front of the building, you can find more restored features, such as station signs, token poles, and replicas of railway station wagons that once plied the tracks.


**Railway Staff Quarters **

The conserved Railway Staff Quarters is a former staff housing block which has been repurposed into a café, called ['1932 STORY'](https://www.instagram.com/1932story/) with a rustic, relaxed ambience. Key architectural elements of the building were also restored, and improvements made to make the building more accessible.

It is open to public daily, from 9am to 9pm. For more information on the café, click [HERE](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/activities/dining/tenants).

The Railway Staff Quarters features two new gardens – Kampung Garden, and Herb and Spice Garden.

Check out the ornamental shrubs and flowers iconic to Singapore’s 1960s landscape in the Kampung Garden. They include the Bunga Raya (*Hibiscus rosa-sinensis*), Peacock Flower (*Caesalpinia pulcherrima*), and the Arabian Jasmine (*Jasminum sambac ‘Arabian Nights’*).

The Herb and Spice Garden showcases plants like Siamese Ginger (*Zingiber officinale*), Laksa Leaf (*Persicaria odorata*) and Cili Padi (*Capsicum frutescens*) that were commonly used for homecooked dishes.


**Yard shelter**

A new sheltered Yard serves as a rest area and gathering point, with public restrooms that simulate rustic toilets found in the old days. The Yard also features an educational board that shares with visitors the history of the railway.
