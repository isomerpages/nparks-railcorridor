If you're cycling at the Rail Corridor, be sure to ride safely, slow down and give way to pedestrians, and dismount and push your bikes when approaching narrow stretches.

Other users can also play your part, for example by being attentive to your surroundings and giving way to faster-moving users.

 

Due to enhancement works along the Rail Corridor, certain stretches have been closed. Diverted routes are available for you to walk along. Please visit [here](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/railcorridor/enhancement-plans) for the updated maps to guide your journey on the Rail Corridor.
