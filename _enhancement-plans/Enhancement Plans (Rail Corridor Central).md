A series of enhancement works along Rail Corridor (Central), spanning about 4 km between Upp Bt Timah truss bridge and Bt Timah truss bridge, was completed in 2021. The enhancement works include improvements to user accessibility, sensitive refurbishment of heritage truss bridges, and restoration of a belt of native forest to enhance the biodiversity and greenery of the Rail Corridor.
