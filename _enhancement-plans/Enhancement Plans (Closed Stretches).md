**Central**

A series of enhancement works along Rail Corridor (Central), spanning about 4 km between Upp Bt Timah truss bridge and Bt Timah truss bridge, was completed in 2021. The enhancement works include improvements to user accessibility, sensitive refurbishment of heritage truss bridges, and restoration of a belt of native forest to enhance the biodiversity and greenery of the Rail Corridor.

Plans to enhance the Bukit Timah Railway Station and its surroundings as a community node include restoring and repurposing the conserved Railway Station as a heritage gallery, planting species that were commonly found in a 1960s kampong, and providing amenities such as toilets and bicycle racks. The enhancement works to the Bukit Timah Railway Station will be complete by mid-2022.
