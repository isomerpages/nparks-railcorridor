Since early 2020, the stretch of Rail Corridor between Upper Bukit Timah Truss Bridge and opposite Dairy Farm Road has been closed for trail enhancement works. Other than improving the trail itself, several infrastructure works will also be taking place to improve the access to Rail Corridor.

A new steel bridge (where the former KTM bridge sits) over Hillview Road will be built while the existing pedestrian overhead bridge along Upper Bukit Timah Road will be extended to connect directly to the trail along Rail Corridor thus allowing for seamless connection between the Rail Corridor and the Rail Mall. New ramps will also be built at Hume Avenue and Hillview Road for residents and commuters to have direct access to the Rail Corridor.

An observation deck near the Upper Bukit Timah truss bridge will be built to allow visitors to get a birdâ€™s eye view of the Rail Mall against the backdrop of the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve.

To improve road connectivity in the Hillview estate, LTA will be building a new road extension to connect Hillview Avenue to Upper Bukit Timah Road and Dairy Farm Road and at the same time enhance the nature and recreational connectivity along the Rail Corridor. This road extension would be covered with green roof, thus allowing visitors to the Rail Corridor to have a seamless journey along the Rail Corridor. In addition, there will also be ramps built to provide pedestrians a direct access between Hillview Avenue and Upper Bukit Timah Road.
