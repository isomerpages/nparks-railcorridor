To improve road connectivity in the Hillview estate, LTA will be building a new road extension to connect Hillview Avenue to Upper Bukit Timah Road and Dairy Farm Road and at the same time enhance the nature and recreational connectivity along the Rail Corridor. This road extension would be covered with green roof, thus allowing visitors to the Rail Corridor to have a seamless journey along the Rail Corridor. In addition, there will also be ramps built to provide pedestrians a direct access between Hillview Avenue and Upper Bukit Timah Road.
