On 10 February 2023, the National Parks Board (NParks) and Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) opened Rail Corridor (North), which marks more than 21km of continuous connectivity for visitors along the Rail Corridor. The public can now explore the Rail Corridor, stretching from Kranji MRT station in the north to Spooner Road in the south, with more than 30 access paths connecting neighboring residents and communities to the Rail Corridor.

Located opposite Kranji MRT station, the new Kranji node features a rustic nature trail connected to a 2,000 sqm events field for community events, and an enhanced trail that connects to the central and southern sections of the Rail Corridor.

Hillview Bridge, which was dismantled in 2011, has also been replaced, thus re-establishing pedestrian connectivity across Hillview Road and along the Rail Corridor. Railway tracks were embedded into the flooring of the bridge to remind visitors of the Rail Corridorâ€™s history as a railway.
