The 24km long Rail Corridor is an important ecological corridor that allows wildlife movement between major green spaces and forest habitats such as Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and Dairy Farm Nature Park. As part of habitat enhancement, native trees have been planted along the corridor to extend the habitats for wildlife movement and foraging areas.The long stretch of Rail Corridor has an important ecological role in providing our wildlife a connection to move between surrounding forest habitats such as Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and Dairy Farm Nature Park. As part of habitat enhancement, many native trees were planted along the corridor for wildlife movement and foraging areas. 

A biodiversity survey known as the BioBlitz, was conducted on May 2018 to document the fauna species spotted at the Rail Corridor. Sightings of many forest bird species such as the Greater Racket-tailed Drongo (_Dicrurus paradiseus_), Straw-headed Bulbul (_Pycnonotus zeylanicus_), and Changeable Hawk-Eagle (*Spizaetus cirrhatus*) were recorded. Forest butterfly species such as the Common Birdwing (_Troides_ _helena_ _cerberus_), and The Archduke (_Lexias pardalis dirteana_) have also been sighted.
