The long stretch of Rail Corridor has an important ecological role in providing our wildlife a connection to move between surrounding forest habitats such as Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and Dairy Farm Nature Park. As part of habitat enhancement, many native trees were planted along the corridor for wildlife movement and foraging areas. 

A biodiversity survey known as the BioBlitz, was conducted on May 2018 to document the fauna species spotted at the Rail Corridor. To find out more about BioBlitz, please [click here.](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/biodiversity/community-in-nature-initiative/bioblitz)
