Enhancements are being done to the railway heritage structures to preserve the cultural heritage as well as to improve public access to these sites.

Biodiversity and Greenery: Distinctive landscape experiences for visitors, and strengthened ecological connection between green spaces.

Recreation: An inclusive hub with open spaces that cater to a range of recreational activities and needs of different users.

The Rail Corridor was formerly known as the Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) Railway Line, and was used as a mode of transportation between Singapore and Malaysia in the early 1900s.
