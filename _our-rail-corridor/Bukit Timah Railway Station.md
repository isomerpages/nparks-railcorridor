<p>The conserved Bukit Timah Railway Station building was built in 1932 and
is one of two extant railway stations in Singapore. Along with its key
architectural and railway elements, the railway station has been sensitively
and carefully restored and repurposed as a heritage gallery for visitors
to learn about its history and that of the Rail Corridor.</p>
<p>In the building, you can see restored elements like track switching levers,
ticketing booth, and a replica of a signals diagram in the Signal Room,
which former Station Masters used to control rail traffic. Do note that
entry to the Signal Room is not allowed, but you can observe its interior
from the entrance. To the front of the building, you can find more restored
features, such as station signs, token poles, and replicas of railway station
wagons that once plied the tracks.</p>
<h4><strong>Railway Staff Quarters</strong></h4>

<p>The conserved Railway Staff Quarters is a former staff housing block which
offers a quiet glimpse into the nation's transport heritage. The architectural
elements of the building were also restored, and improvements made to make
the building more accessible.</p>
