Designed by The Rail Explorers from Hwa Chong Institution, [THE RAIL CORRIDOR GUIDE SHEET](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/-/media/rail-corridor/rc-resources/trifold-guidesheet.ashx) introduces you to the history, iconic sites, flora and fauna of the Rail Corridor. 


**RailWild**

Developed by Tanvi Gupta, [RAILWILD](http://railwild.org/) introduces you to the world of local biodiversity through an easy identification interface. Covering 93 different species found along the Rail Corridor, RailWild guides users through the identification process by prompting them to making a series of observations, eventually leading to the species of interest.

**Speaking of which – Rail Corridor: A Living Blueprint**

_Speaking of which_ is a series of self-guided audio trails that uncovers stories and invites renewed readings of the places in which we live. In episode 01 Rail Corridor: _A Living Blueprint_, explore the southern stretch from the old Signal Cabin at Spooner Road to areas adjacent to Jalan Bukit Merah, Telok Blangah and Jalan Kilang Barat, and uncover stories of the many guests – both human and non-human – that the old railway line has played host to through archival records and oral interviews interspersed with commissioned audio works.

_Speaking of which_ is commissioned by The Everyday Museum, a public art initiative by Singapore Art Museum, in partnership with the National Archives of Singapore. Find out more [here](https://www.theeverydaymuseum.sg/event/a-living-blueprint/).
