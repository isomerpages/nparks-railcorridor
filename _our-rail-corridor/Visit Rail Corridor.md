<h4><strong>About Rail Corridor</strong></h4>
<p>The Rail Corridor was conceptualised together with various stakeholders,
including members of public, as a 24-kilometre ecological route connecting
Woodlands to Tanjong Pagar, which would allow wildlife movement between
major green spaces along the route. It would also serve as a recreational
corridor for members of the public to engage in activities such as hiking
and cycling. To accommodate such diverse recreational uses while preserving
the area’s rustic charm, the Rail Corridor provides two distinct types
of trails:</p>
<p>1. Porous Bound Aggregate (PBA) Trail: The southern stretch, from Rifle
Range Road to Tanjong Pagar, features this trail, which is composed of
natural materials such as gravel and crushed stone, bound together with
a permeable binder. The porous nature of PBA reduces the risk of puddles
after rain and provides visitors with a connection to nature while still
reflecting the urban landscape.</p>
<p>2. Grass and Gravel Trail: The stretch from Rifle Range Road to Kranji
features a more naturalistic trail made of grass and gravel, blending with
the surrounding vegetated areas. It offers a more rustic and immersive
experience for visitors to engage closely with nature.</p>

<p>As it is an important ecological corridor, the Rail Corridor is not lit
at night to facilitate nocturnal wildlife movement. Lighting is only provided
at certain access points, essential walking paths and benches leading to
the public restrooms and Bukit Timah Railway Station building and Railway
Staff Quarters. &nbsp;For safety, we encourage&nbsp;visitors&nbsp;to exit
the Rail Corridor by nightfall, and to take extra care if you are still
within Rail Corridor when it gets dark.</p>

<h4><strong>Park Etiquette</strong></h4>

Corridor, please note the 10km/h speed limit. Be sure to ride safely, slow
down and give way to pedestrians, ring your bell when overtaking, and dismount
and push your bicycles when crossing our bridges.</p>

fauna from a distance.</p>
