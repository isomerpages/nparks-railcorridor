<h4><strong>About Rail Corridor</strong></h4>
<p>The 24 km long Rail Corridor is a continuous green passage that allows
wildlife movement between major green spaces. It also serves as a recreational
corridor for&nbsp;all members of the public.</p>
<p>As it is an important ecological corridor, the Rail Corridor is not lit
at night to facilitate nocturnal wildlife movement. Lighting is only provided
at certain access points, essential walking paths and benches leading to
the public restrooms and Bukit Timah Railway Station building and Railway
Staff Quarters. &nbsp;For safety, we encourage&nbsp;visitors&nbsp;to exit
the Rail Corridor by nightfall, and to take extra care if you are still
within Rail Corridor when it gets dark.</p>
<h4><strong>Park Etiquette</strong></h4>
<p>For an enjoyable experience along the Rail Corridor, here are some simple
tips:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep left at all times
and keep noise level down</p>
<p>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If&nbsp;you are&nbsp;cycling along the Rail
Corridor, please note the 10km/h speed limit. Be sure to ride safely, slow
down and give way to pedestrians, ring your bell when overtaking, and dismount
and push your bicycles when crossing our bridges.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be&nbsp;attentive to
your surroundings and&nbsp;give&nbsp;way&nbsp;to others</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observe our flora and
fauna from a distance.</p>
<h4><strong>Safety During Bad Weather</strong></h4>
<p>For safety, during and immediately after bad weather, please seek cover
at the nearest shelter available and avoid entering forested areas, including
nature reserves and nature parks.</p>
<p>Do note that when planning to go outdoors, you may dial <u>65427788</u> for
weather forecasts.</p>
