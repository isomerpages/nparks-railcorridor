<h4>2. Why is this section of the Rail Corridor (South) closed?</h4>

trail will be rebuilt with a stronger foundation to improve long-term durability.</p>

<h4>3. What improvements are being made to the trail?</h4>
<p>The existing trail has deteriorated over time. As part of the upgrade,
the trail is being rebuilt with a stronger concrete foundation in place
of the previous granite base. This will make the trail more durable and
reduce future maintenance needs.</p>
<h4>4. Why is the closure being extended to Spooner Road?</h4>
<p>The section near Spooner Road serves as the access point for heavy construction
vehicles to enter and exit. For the safety of pedestrians and other park
users, this section will be closed.</p>
<p>The closure started in November 2025 as part of phased trail improvement
works. From 2 March 2026, a section of the Rail Corridor (indicated in
red) from Blk 138 Jalan Bukit Merah to Spooner Road will be closed to facilitate
the access of heavy construction vehicles for the improvement works. This
closure is part of the ongoing improvement works for the Rail Corridor.</p>
<h4>5. When did the closure start?</h4>

<h4>6. How long will this section of Rail Corridor (South) remain closed?</h4>
<p>The Rail Corridor (South) will be closed in phases for essential trail
improvement works. While the works are being carried out in stages, the
entire affected section will remain closed to:</p>
<p>• Facilitate the ingress and egress of heavy construction vehicles and
equipment and ensure public safety; and</p>
<p>• Allow the works to proceed smoothly and efficiently, by minimising disruptions</p>
<p>The Rail Corridor will be also reopened in phases, with the following
expected completion dates:</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1 </strong>(Jalan Kilang Barat to Henderson Road): 31 July
2026</p>
<p><strong>Phase 2 </strong>(Henderson Road to Blk 138 Jalan Bukit Merah):
31 July 2027</p>
<p>Alternative routes are clearly marked to help users access other parts
of the Rail Corridor during this period. We appreciate users’ understanding
and cooperation as we work to enhance the experience on the Rail Corridor.</p>
<h4>7. Will any part of the Rail Corridor be reopened earlier?</h4>
<p>Yes. Currently the section from Jalan Kilang Barat to Henderson Road is
expected to reopen by 31 March 2026, ahead of the initial expected completion
date of 31 July 2026, subject to construction progress and site conditions.</p>
<h4>8. Why do the repair works take such a long time?</h4>
<p>The trail will be rebuilt with a stronger foundation to improve long-term
durability. The works involve removing the existing trail surface and its
foundation, stabilising the ground underneath, and rebuilding the trail
with a stronger, more durable base. The full closure of this section of
the Rail Corridor will facilitate heavy vehicle movement for these trail
works and ensure public safety.</p>
<h4>9. Is the closed section currently unsafe to use?</h4>
<p>Users are not permitted to enter the closed section of the Rail Corridor
as the surface is not even, and may pose a tripping hazard, especially
during wet weather or under low light conditions.</p>
<h4>10. Can part of the trail be kept open during the repair works, i.e. half of the width remains open for access?</h4>
<p>Due to safety concerns and the nature of the works, the entire affected
section must be fully closed. Trail repairs require heavy machinery and
full‑width resurfacing, making it unsafe for users to pass through. Users
are advised to use the designated alternative route outside the Rail Corridor.</p>
<p>The Rail Corridor is also an important ecological corridor, and closing
the trail completely will help to minimise disturbance to the wildlife
during works, thus protecting the habitats and maintaining the ecological
integrity of the area.</p>
<h4>11. Can I still walk, jog or cycle through the closed section?</h4>
<p>No. For your safety, walking, jogging and cycling are not allowed within
the closed section. Users should only use the open sections of Rail Corridor.</p>
<h4>12. Can I still access this closed section of Rail Corridor for events or group activities?</h4>
<p>No, group activities and events cannot be held within the closed section
during the closure. For activities in other parts of the Rail Corridor,
a permit is still required, and users should adhere to all park guidelines.</p>
<h4>13. Are there alternative routes available?</h4>
<p>Yes. Alternative walking and cycling routes are available on public paths
and roads. Wayfinding signs have been placed on-site to guide users. Users
may also refer to the following <a href="https://go.gov.sg/rcsouth01" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">alternative route.</a>
</p>
<p>We acknowledge that the alternative routes are less convenient and less
attractive than the Rail Corridor. We have structured the works into two
phases and will reopen the first stretch from Jalan Kilang Barat to Henderson
Road in 3Q 2026 and will strive to complete the improvement works as soon
as possible. We look forward to welcoming users back to the Rail Corridor.</p>
<h4>14. How will I know if there are changes to the closure timeline?</h4>
<p>Updates will be shared on the NParks website and via physical notices
on-site.</p>
<h4>15. Who can I contact for feedback or safety concerns?</h4>
<p>You can contact NParks via the NParks helpline 1800 471 7300, the OneService
app, or the feedback channels listed on closure notices online.</p>
